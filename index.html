        01.01. 'The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a
        disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the
        life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but
        they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have
        subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread
        psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as
        well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The
        continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will
        certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict
        greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater
        social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to
        increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.02. 'The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break
        down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical
        and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and
        very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently
        reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered
        products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system
        survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of
        reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving
        people of dignity and autonomy.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.03. 'If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very
        painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results
        of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break
        down sooner rather than later.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.04. 'We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial
        system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be
        sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades.
        We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way
        the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in
        order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society.
        This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to
        overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of
        the present society.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.05. 'In this article we give attention to only some of the negative
        developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system.
        Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether.
        This does not mean that we regard these other developments as
        unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to
        areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we
        have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed
        environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little
        about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even
        though we consider these to be highly important.'

    <h1 id="sub">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM;</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        02.01. 'Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled
        society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of
        our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can
        serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern
        society in general.'
      </p>
      <p>
        02.02. 'But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century
        leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the
        movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a
        leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind
        mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types,
        feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the
        like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is
        a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so
        much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a
        collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge
        more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology.'
      </p>
      <p>
        02.03. ' Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less
        clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for
        this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and
        approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the
        main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling
        the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant
        to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the
        extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the
        19th and early 20th centuries.'
      </p>
      <p>
        02.04. 'The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we
        call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of
        inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while
        oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern
        leftism; but this segment is highly influential.'
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="sub">FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY;</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        03.01. 'By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority
        feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low
        self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies,
        defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend
        to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that
        these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern
        leftism.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.02. 'When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is
        said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude
        that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is
        pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong
        to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive
        about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is
        said concerning minorities. The terms “negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped”
        or “chick” for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman
        originally had no derogatory connotation. “Broad” and “chick” were
        merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” The
        negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists
        themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject
        the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion.”
        Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything
        about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as
        negative. They want to replace the world “primitive” by “nonliterate.”
        They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any
        primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that
        primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the
        hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.03. 'Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect”
        terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant,
        abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of
        whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from
        privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold
        among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable
        salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from
        middle- to upper-middle-class families.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.04. 'Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems
        of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American
        Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists
        themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit
        to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because
        they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their
        problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE
        inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.05. 'Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as
        strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that
        women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.06. 'Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being
        strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western
        civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons
        that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond
        with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is
        warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where
        these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive
        cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY
        admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and
        often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western
        civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist’s
        real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the
        West because they are strong and successful.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.07. 'Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,”
        “enterprise,” “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and
        leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic,
        pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone’s problems for
        them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. He is not
        the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability
        to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is
        antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he
        feels like a loser.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.08. 'Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to
        focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic
        tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of
        accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was
        left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.09. 'Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science,
        objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative.
        It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of
        scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective
        reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish
        philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically
        analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved
        emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these
        concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their
        attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is
        successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the
        leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain
        beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false
        (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist’s feelings of inferiority run so
        deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as
        successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also
        underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental
        illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to
        genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such
        explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to
        others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an
        individual’s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is “inferior” it is
        not his fault, but society’s, because he has not been brought up
        properly.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.10. 'The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings
        of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a
        self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly
        lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and
        self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity
        to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his
        unpleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His
        feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of
        himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of
        the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization
        or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.11. 'Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists
        protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke
        police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be
        effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but
        because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist
        trait.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.12. ' Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by
        compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role
        for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral
        principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is
        too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for
        power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to
        be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to
        help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for
        black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile
        or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a
        diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and
        symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action
        discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an
        approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping
        black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an
        excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for
        power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the
        activists’ hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify
        race hatred.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.13. ' If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists
        would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an
        excuse for making a fuss.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.14. 'We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an
        accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It
        is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.'
