    <h1 id="cred">Published by Theodore ‘UNA-BOMBER’ Kaczynski.</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        01.01. 'The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a
        disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the
        life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but
        they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have
        subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread
        psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as
        well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The
        continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will
        certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict
        greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater
        social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to
        increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.02. 'The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break
        down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical
        and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and
        very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently
        reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered
        products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system
        survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of
        reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving
        people of dignity and autonomy.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.03. 'If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very
        painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results
        of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break
        down sooner rather than later.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.04. 'We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial
        system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be
        sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades.
        We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way
        the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in
        order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society.
        This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to
        overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of
        the present society.'
      </p>
      <p>
        01.05. 'In this article we give attention to only some of the negative
        developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system.
        Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether.
        This does not mean that we regard these other developments as
        unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to
        areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we
        have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed
        environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little
        about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even
        though we consider these to be highly important.'

    <h1 id="sub">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM;</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        02.01. 'Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled
        society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of
        our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can
        serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern
        society in general.'
      </p>
      <p>
        02.02. 'But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century
        leftism could have been practically identified with socialism. Today the
        movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a
        leftist. When we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind
        mainly socialists, collectivists, “politically correct” types,
        feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the
        like. But not everyone who is associated with one of these movements is
        a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not so
        much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a
        collection of related types. Thus, what we mean by “leftism” will emerge
        more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology.'
      </p>
      <p>
        02.03. ' Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less
        clear than we would wish, but there doesn’t seem to be any remedy for
        this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and
        approximate way the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the
        main driving force of modern leftism. We by no means claim to be telling
        the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant
        to apply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the
        extent to which our discussion could be applied to the leftists of the
        19th and early 20th centuries.'
      </p>
      <p>
        02.04. 'The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we
        call “feelings of inferiority” and “oversocialization.” Feelings of
        inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while
        oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern
        leftism; but this segment is highly influential.'
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="sub">FEELINGS OF INFERIORITY;</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        03.01. 'By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority
        feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low
        self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies,
        defeatism, guilt, self- hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend
        to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that
        these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern
        leftism.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.02. 'When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is
        said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude
        that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is
        pronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong
        to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive
        about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is
        said concerning minorities. The terms “negro,” “oriental,” “handicapped”
        or “chick” for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman
        originally had no derogatory connotation. “Broad” and “chick” were
        merely the feminine equivalents of “guy,” “dude” or “fellow.” The
        negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists
        themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject
        the word “pet” and insist on its replacement by “animal companion.”
        Leftish anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything
        about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as
        negative. They want to replace the world “primitive” by “nonliterate.”
        They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any
        primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that
        primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the
        hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.03. 'Those who are most sensitive about “politically incorrect”
        terminology are not the average black ghetto- dweller, Asian immigrant,
        abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of
        whom do not even belong to any “oppressed” group but come from
        privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold
        among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable
        salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual white males from
        middle- to upper-middle-class families.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.04. 'Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems
        of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American
        Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists
        themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit
        to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because
        they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their
        problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE
        inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.05. 'Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as
        strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that
        women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.06. 'Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being
        strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western
        civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons
        that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond
        with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is
        warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where
        these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive
        cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY
        admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and
        often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western
        civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist’s
        real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the
        West because they are strong and successful.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.07. 'Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,”
        “enterprise,” “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and
        leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic,
        pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone’s problems for
        them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. He is not
        the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability
        to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is
        antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he
        feels like a loser.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.08. 'Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to
        focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or else they take an orgiastic
        tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of
        accomplishing anything through rational calculation and all that was
        left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the moment.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.09. 'Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science,
        objective reality and to insist that everything is culturally relative.
        It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of
        scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective
        reality can be defined. But it is obvious that modern leftish
        philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically
        analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved
        emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They attack these
        concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their
        attack is an outlet for hostility, and, to the extent that it is
        successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the
        leftist hates science and rationality because they classify certain
        beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other beliefs as false
        (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist’s feelings of inferiority run so
        deep that he cannot tolerate any classification of some things as
        successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also
        underlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental
        illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists are antagonistic to
        genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such
        explanations tend to make some persons appear superior or inferior to
        others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame for an
        individual’s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is “inferior” it is
        not his fault, but society’s, because he has not been brought up
        properly.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.10. 'The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings
        of inferiority make him a braggart, an egotist, a bully, a
        self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly
        lost faith in himself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and
        self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having the capacity
        to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his
        unpleasant behavior. [1] But the leftist is too far gone for that. His
        feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of
        himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of
        the leftist. He can feel strong only as a member of a large organization
        or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.11. 'Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists
        protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they intentionally provoke
        police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be
        effective, but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but
        because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a leftist
        trait.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.12. ' Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by
        compassion or by moral principles, and moral principle does play a role
        for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral
        principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is
        too prominent a component of leftist behavior; so is the drive for
        power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to
        be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to
        help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is good for
        black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile
        or dogmatic terms? Obviously it would be more productive to take a
        diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and
        symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action
        discriminates against them. But leftist activists do not take such an
        approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs. Helping
        black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an
        excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for
        power. In doing so they actually harm black people, because the
        activists’ hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify
        race hatred.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.13. ' If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists
        would have to INVENT problems in order to provide themselves with an
        excuse for making a fuss.'
      </p>
      <p>
        03.14. 'We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an
        accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist. It
        is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.'
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="sub">OVERSOCIALIZATION;</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        04.01. 'Psychologists use the term “socialization” to designate the
        process by which children are trained to think and act as society
        demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and
        obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning
        part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists
        are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel.
        Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such
        rebels as they seem.'
      </p>
      <p>
        04.02. 'The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can
        think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not
        supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time
        or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so
        highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally
        imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt,
        they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and
        find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a
        non-moral origin. We use the term “oversocialized” to describe such
        people.'
      </p>
      <p>
        04.03. 'Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of
        powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by
        which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of
        behavior or speech that is contrary to society’s expectations. If this
        is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such
        feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought
        and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by
        society’s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person.
        The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty
        behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws,
        they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or
        they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The
        oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he
        generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The
        oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or
        feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think
        “unclean” thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality;
        we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall
        under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on
        a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society
        has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a
        sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We
        suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that
        human beings inflict on one another.'
      </p>
      <p>
        04.04. 'We argue that a very important and influential segment of the
        modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of
        great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism.
        Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members
        of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3]
        constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also
        the most left-wing segment.'
      </p>
      <p>
        04.05. 'The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his
        psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he
        is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society.
        Generally speaking, the goals of today’s leftists are NOT in conflict
        with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted
        moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream
        society of violating that principle. Examples: racial equality, equality
        of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to war, nonviolence
        generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More
        fundamentally, the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty
        of society to take care of the individual. All these have been deeply
        rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper
        classes [4] for a long time. These values are explicitly or implicitly
        expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the
        mainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists,
        especially those of the oversocialized type, usually do not rebel
        against these principles but justify their hostility to society by
        claiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to
        these principles.'
      </p>
      <p>
        04.06. 'Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized
        leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our
        society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists
        push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige
        jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such
        schools; the way of life of the black “underclass” they regard as a
        social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system,
        make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like
        upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last
        thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man;
        instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what
        does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can
        hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening
        to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-
        style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in
        superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the
        oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white,
        middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects,
        become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status
        ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to
        make black fathers “responsible,” they want black gangs to become
        nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the
        industrial-technological system. The system couldn’t care less what kind
        of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what
        religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a
        respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a “responsible” parent, is
        nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the
        oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system
        and make him adopt its values.'

        04.07. 'We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the
        oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the fundamental values of our
        society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have
        gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society’s most important
        principles by engaging in physical violence. By their own account,
        violence is for them a form of “liberation.” In other words, by
        committing violence they break through the psychological restraints that
        have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized these
        restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence
        their need to break free of them. But they usually justify their
        rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they
        claim to be fighting against racism or the like.'

        04.08. 'We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing
        thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. The real situation is complex,
        and anything like a complete description of it would take several
        volumes even if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have
        indicated very roughly the two most important tendencies in the
        psychology of modern leftism.'

        04.09. 'The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of
        our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, depressive tendencies and
        defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially
        noticeable in the left, they are widespread in our society. And today’s
        society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than any previous
        society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to
        make love, how to raise our kids and so forth.'

    <h1 id="sub">THE POWER PROCESS;</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>05.01. 'Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the “power process.” This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later.'</p>
      <p>05.02. 'Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one’s power.'</p>
      <p>05.03. 'Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever clothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things without effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.'</p>
      <p>05.04. ' Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration if nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.'</p>
      <p>05.05. 'Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.'</p>
